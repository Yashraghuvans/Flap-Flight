A simple, addictive, and challenging endless flyer game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird.

## üìñ About The Game

Flap-Flight is a hyper-casual arcade game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. This project was developed as a way to master core mechanics in the Unity game engine, including physics, user input, procedural generation, and UI management. The goal was to create a polished, simple, and infinitely replayable experience that is both challenging and fun.
